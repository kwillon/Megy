Description of columns, and their conventional units:
0. link - source resource reference
1. Effective anisotropy constant (Keff) [J/m³] - is a measure of the energy required to change the direction of magnetization in a magnetic material. 
2. magnetic anisotropy constant (K) [J/m³] -  is a material property that characterizes the energy required to change the orientation of magnetization within the material.
3. Anisotropy constant [J/m³] - is a material property that quantifies the energy required to change the direction of magnetization in a magnetic material. This energy is associated with magnetic anisotropy, which refers to the preferred orientation of magnetic moments within the material.
4. magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) [J/m³] - is a term used in the context of magnetism to describe the energy associated with the preferred orientation of magnetic moments in a crystalline material.
5-7. length, width, depth [nm] - particle parameters in xyz axes.
8. mass magnetic susceptibility [emu/Oe*g]  is a measure of how a material responds to an applied magnetic field in terms of its mass. It is defined as the ratio of the magnetization of a material to the applied magnetic field. 
9. Core_composition_formula - the composition of the nanoparticle core, the column type is string.
10. magnetization reversibility - ability of a magnetic material to undergo a reversible change in its magnetization under the influence of an external magnetic field.
11. Curie temperature (Tc) [K] - is a critical temperature at which certain materials undergo a phase transition, changing their magnetic properties. 
12. exchange constant (J/m) *10^-12 (A) [× 10^−12 J/m] - is a parameter used to describe the strength of magnetic exchange interactions between neighboring atoms in a magnetic material. 
13. Crystalline - categorical parameter, crystallity of material.
14. interdomain coupling (α) - is a term used to describe the interaction or coupling strength between adjacent magnetic domains within a magnetic material.
15. pinning loss [A/m] - energy associated with the pinning of domain walls, and this energy per unit.
16. Spehricity - sphericity of the nanoparticle, the column was originally filled incorrectly, so it will trigger a ring in the code.
17. volume - the volume of the nanoparticle, the column was originally filled incorrectly, so it will ring the code.
18. surface area
19. Electronegativity core - the electronegativity of the core, the column initially filled with units.
20. Elongation - describes the extent to which a particle's structure is stretched or extended along a particular axis.
21. Flatness - specifically indicates how closely the nanoparticle resembles a flat or planar structure.
22. Space group - is a way to describe the symmetrical arrangement of atoms within a crystal lattice. 
23. Demagnetization factors (Nd) -  is a parameter used in magnetostatics and magnetism to account for the demagnetizing effects in magnetic materials, particularly in the context of magnetic fields and magnetization.
24. Saturation magnetization (Ms) [emu/g] - is a measure of the maximum magnetic moment per unit mass that a material can attain under the influence of an external magnetic field.
25. Coercivity (Hс) [Oe] -  is a measure of a magnetic material's resistance to demagnetization.
26. Remanence magnetization (Mr) [emu/g] - is a measure of the residual magnetization retained by a magnetic material when an external magnetic field is removed after magnetization.
27. Shell composition (surface) - nanomaterial shell composition.
28. shape name - nanoparticle shape name.
29. Max/min(size) - ratio of the largest to the smallest nanoparticle.
30. surface - material on the surface.
31. pol
32. surf
33. Magnetic moment of core (μ) - refers to the magnetic dipole moment associated with the individual atoms or molecules within the core material.
34. LogP of organic coating - is calculated by taking the logarithm (usually base 10) of the ratio of the concentration of a compound in octanol to its concentration in water at equilibrium. 
35. Number H acceptors of organic coating
36. Field amplitude -  refers to the maximum magnitude of a field oscillation in a wave or a periodic signal. 
37. Field frequency -  refers to the maximum magnitude of a field oscillation in a wave or a periodic signal.
38. SAR [W/kg] - (Specific Absorption Rate) is not directly related to magnetism; instead, it is a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the human body when exposed to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields.
39. magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant (Ku) [J/m3] -  is a material-specific parameter that characterizes the dependence of a material's magnetic energy on the direction of magnetization with respect to its crystal lattice.
