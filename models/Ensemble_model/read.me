The Curie_ML_choice file of the target variable is the curie temperature, and Eff_anisotropy_ML_choice is the effective anisotropy. The files also compare the metric values of several machine learning models, select the two best and build their visualizations, as well as shap diagrams to see the effect of different predict variables on the target
